\chapter{Statistical Connectomics} \label{chap:chap-3}

This chapter documents our first investigation into the alpha blocker treatment hypothesis in humans facing a severe respiratory illness. Importantly, this study leveraged large insurance claims databases and common health conditions during a period where the COVID-19 data environment was too immature to produce a sufficiently large and well-understood sample for this analysis. This chapter was originally published in Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application in March 2021 (DOI: \url{https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-023234}) and is distributed under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution License that permits unrestricted use and redistribution provided that the original author and source are credited.

\section*{Abstract}
The data science of networks is a rapidly developing field with myriad applications.  In neuroscience, the brain is commonly modeled as a connectome, a network of nodes connected by edges. While there have been thousands of papers on connectomics, the statistics of networks remains limited and poorly understood.  Here, we provide an overview from the perspective of statistical network science of the kinds of models, assumptions, problems, and applications that are theoretically and empirically justified for analysis of connectome data.  We hope this review spurs further development and application of statistically grounded methods in connectomics.
