\chap{Acknowledgement}
First and foremost, I’d like to thank my advisor Dr. Joshua T. Vogelstein. Without Joshua, none of this would have been possible. He has always supported me and made sure that my research was in line with my zone of genius. I have learned a great deal from him about what it means to be a great researcher.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to my thesis committee members. To Dr. Carey E. Priebe, for the inspiring discussions on statistical theory and pattern recognition. To Dr. Michael Powell, whom I regard as both a colleague and a professional role model. From them, I have learned far more than intellectual skills; most importantly, I have learned that all the research we dedicate ourselves to should be immensely enjoyable -- otherwise, why bother? 

To the members of the NeuroData lab, past and present: your input has been invaluable throughout my thesis work, refining both my research and my perspective on these challenges. I appreciate your insightful feedback, the fun times playing frisbee on the lawn, and the opportunity to learn from your projects. 

Finally, I could never have gotten this far without my friends and family. I thank my parents and brother who have given me everything I’ve ever needed for the life I live and have supported me from Day 0 to Day -1. My girlfriend and partner, Seungyeon Lee, who has been steadfast in her support and gives me great joy as I look forward to the next chapter.
