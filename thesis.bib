	abstract     = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.},

The . Abstract . This paper examine the Euler - Lagrange equations for the solution of the large deformation diffeomor - phic metric mapping problem studied in Dupuis et al . (1998) and Trouv{\'{e}} (1995) in which two images I 0 , I 1 are given and connected via the diffeomorphic change of coordinates I 0 • ϕ −1 = I 1 where ϕ = $\phi$ 1 is the end point at t = 1 of curve $\phi$ t , t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] satisfying ˙ $\phi$ t = v t ($\phi$ t) , t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] with $\phi$ 0 = id . The variational problem takes the form argmin v : ˙ $\phi$ t =v t ($\phi$ t) 1 0 v t 2 V dt + I 0 • $\phi$ −1 1 − I 1 2 L 2 , where v t V is an appropriate Sobolev norm on the velocity field v t ({\textperiodcentered}) , and the second term enforces matching of the images with {\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered} L 2 representing the squared - error norm . In this paper we derive the Euler - Lagrange equations characterizing the minimizing vector fields v t , t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] assuming sufficient smoothness of the norm to guarantee existence of solutions in the space of diffeomorphisms . We describe the implementation of the Euler equations using semi - Lagrangian method of computing particle flows and show the solutions for various examples . We also compute the metric distance on several anatomical configurations as measured by 1 0 v t V dt on the geodesic shortest paths . 140 Beg et al .},
