Models are important, but also should be used to understand the assumptions and can only make claims and limited to the assumptions of the models themselves. We hope that this thesis

This thesis presented novel methods for extracting principles from complex brain connectivity data, and demonstrated the application of these tools primarily on the connectome of a Drosophila larva brain. Despite these advances, many avenues remain for expanding upon this work and developing methods which will enable further biologically relevant inferences from connectome data.
