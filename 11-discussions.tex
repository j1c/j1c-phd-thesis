\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{chap:discussion}

This thesis presented novel methods for extracting principles from complex brain connectivity data, and demonstrated the application of these tools primarily on the connectome of a Drosophila larva brain. Despite these advances, many avenues remain for expanding upon this work and developing methods which will enable further biologically relevant inferences from connectome data.
